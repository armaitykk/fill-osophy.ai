This is a FastAPI-based application that uses Generative AI to process legal documents. The API extracts, simplifies, and analyzes legal documents by:

Extracting the text from images or PDFs.
Simplifying the legal text into easy-to-understand bullet points.
Identifying key legal terms and definitions.
Detecting risky or unfair clauses in the document.
Features
Text Extraction: Extracts text from both images (JPG, PNG) and PDFs.
Text Simplification: Uses Generative AI (Gemini AI) to summarize and simplify complex legal text.
Key Term Extraction: Identifies and defines key legal terms in the document.
Risky Clause Detection: Flags potential legal risks or unfair clauses in the document.

Setting Up the API Key
To use Gemini API, you'll need to set up your API key.

Sign up for Google Gemini API and get your API key.
Set the environment variable for the API key:
bash
Copy
Edit
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Running the API
Make sure your environment is set up with the required dependencies and API key.

Start the FastAPI server using uvicorn:

Frontend Integration
The backend API is designed to work with a React frontend. Ensure the frontend is set up to send files to the /upload endpoint of the backend. CORS is enabled for all origins by default, but this should be restricted in production.

Troubleshooting
CORS Errors:
If you're running the frontend locally, make sure CORS middleware is properly configured in the backend. The current configuration allows all origins.

OCR or PDF Text Extraction Issues:
If the extraction process fails, make sure pytesseract is installed correctly, and the necessary OCR tools (like Tesseract) are configured on your system.

Gemini API Errors:
If you encounter errors related to the Gemini API, make sure the API key is set up correctly and that you're not exceeding API usage limits.
